# PedagogyScraper

This repository is part of the project undertaken by a group of students at the University of Alberta for the Winter 2016 session of HUCO530 course.

The project's goal is the creation of a unified database containing information on various courses and academic programs available at North American higher education institutions.

To aggregate data for this database we're planning to build a series of web-scrapers that will pull the necessary information from the official institution websites.

This readme will later contain information on how to use the scraper tool.
